## Introduction

PongHub is an open-source service status monitoring website designed to help users track and verify service availability. It supports:

- **🕵️ Zero-intrusion Monitoring** - Full-featured monitoring without code changes
- **🚀 One-click Deployment** - Automatically built with GitHub Actions, deployed to GitHub Pages
- **🌐 Cross-platform Support** - Compatible with public services like OpenAI and private deployments
- **🔍 Multi-port Detection** - Monitor multiple ports for a single service
- **🤖 Intelligent Response Validation** - Precise matching of status codes and regex validation of response bodies
- **🛠️ Custom Request Engine** - Flexible configuration of request headers/bodies, timeouts, and retry strategies

## Quick Start

1. Star and Fork [PongHub](https://github.com/WCY-dt/ponghub)

2. Modify the [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) file in the root directory to configure your service checks.

3. Modify the [`CNAME`](CNAME) file in the root directory to set your custom domain name.
   
   > If you do not need a custom domain, you can delete the `CNAME` file.

4. Commit and push your changes to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically run and deploy to GitHub Pages and require no intervention.

> [!TIP]
> By default, GitHub Actions runs every 30 minutes. If you need to change the frequency, modify the `cron` expression in the [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file.
> 
> Please do not set the frequency too high to avoid triggering GitHub's rate limits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If GitHub Actions does not trigger automatically, you can manually trigger it once.

```yaml

max_log_days: 30
services:
  - name: "GitHub API"
    health:
      - url: "https://api.github.com"
    api:
      - url: "https://api.github.com/repos/wcy-dt/ponghub"
        method: "GET"
        status_code: 200
        response_regex: "full_name"
  - name: "Ch3nyang's  Websites"
    health:
      - url: "https://example.com/health"
        response_regex: "status"
      - url: "https://example.com/status"
        method: "POST"
        body: '{"key": "value"}'
